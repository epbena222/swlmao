			<p class="paragraphgiza"> The great pyramid of giza was built over a span of 20 years on the giza  plateau near the modern day city of cairo. The king at t1me of construction of the pyramid was Khufu of the 4th dynasty. Until the eiffel tower was made the pyramid of giza was the tallest man made structure in the world. It stands at an astonishing height of 479 feet, with the base of 754 feet. The massive rock bricks that were used to make th kings chamber and the outside of the pyramid were placed so precisely and intricately it almost seems impossible in modern times. It was most likely built as a tomb for king khufu, using hebrew slaves that were known for their good hands. There were multiple pyramids on the giza plateau, built by the kings in the 4th dynasty. Because of what they achieved with such little equipment and knowledge of new technology they were called the pyramid builders.

	<p> The pyramid of Giza is one of greatest pyramids still left to this day. The pyramid was built using engineering techniques that are still a wonder of the world. The oldest and the largest of the 3 pyramids of Giza is the Great Pyramid. It is the only surviving structure of the of the famed Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Though some popular versions of history held that the pyramids were built by slaves or foreigners forced into labor, skeletons excavated from the area show that the workers were probably native Egyptian agricultural laborers who worked on the pyramids during the time of year when the Nile River flooded much of the land nearby. In the modern day Tomb robbers and other vandals in both ancient and modern times removed most of the bodies and funeral goods from Egyptâ€™s pyramids and plundered their exteriors
