	<p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are thought to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon. Even though there is no proof that they actually existed, they are considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is called the Hanging Gardens because the gardens were built high above the ground on multi-level stone terraces. The plants weren't rooted in the earth like a traditional garden. If it existed it was likely the most beautiful man-made gardens ever created. There is no documentation in Babylonian sources that the gardens ever existed. There is also no solid archaeological evidence that they existed.</p>
